# 🌐 Disaster Management System – GitHub Organization

Welcome to **Realsq** the **Disaster Management System** GitHub Organization – an open-source initiative to develop scalable, role-based, and modular disaster response applications capable of handling multiple disasters simultaneously across different regions.

---

## 🚀 About the Organization

This organization hosts a suite of repositories built to manage and coordinate relief efforts during natural or human-made disasters. Our goal is to empower local governments, NGOs, and emergency teams with a centralized, digital-first system to handle multiple disaster scenarios in real-time with:

- **Role-based access and workflows**
- **Support for concurrent multi-disaster operations**
- **Data-driven decision making**
- **Offline-first architecture**
- **Mobile and Web interfaces**

---

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Multi-disaster Support**  
Handle multiple disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes, fires) in parallel with isolated workflows, resources, and statistics.

✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
Manage users by roles such as:
- **Admin**
- **Camp Officer**
- **Volunteer**
- **Collection Point Manager**
- **Statistics Officer**
- **Surveyor**

✅ **Modular Architecture**  
Each component (auth, statistics, donation, camp management, etc.) is modular and can be independently developed or deployed.

✅ **Real-time Sync + Offline Support**  
Critical for remote disaster zones with poor connectivity.

✅ **Notification & Alert System**  
Push alerts for task updates, critical actions, and volunteer coordination.

✅ **Scalable Backend**  
Built on modern, scalable tech like Node.js, Fastify, MongoDB, and Flutter.
